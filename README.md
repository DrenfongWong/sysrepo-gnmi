Supported RPCs:

* [x] Capabilities
* [X] Set
* [X] Get
* [X] Subscribe

Supported encoding:

* [x] No encoding/gNMI native encoding (use `PROTO`)
* [X] JSON IETF encoding  (use `JSON_IETF`)
* [X] JSON encoding (if you ask for `JSON` you will have `JSON_IETF`)
* [ ] ~~Protobuf encoding~~
* [ ] ~~Binary encoding~~
* [ ] ~~ASCII encoding~~

Supported authentication/encryption methods:

* [x] no encryption, no username/password (DEBUGGING ONLY)
* [ ] ~~no encryption, username/password~~

* [x] TLS/SSL encryption & authentication: server and client key pairs (RECOMMENDED)

# Dependencies

```
sysrepo-gnmi
+-- protobuf (>=3.0) #because of gnmi
+-- jsoncpp #because of get JSON
+-- grpc (cpp)
+-- libyang (cpp >=1.0-r3) #because of feature_enable
+-- sysrepo (cpp)
|   +-- libyang
|   +-- ...
```

libyang is a dependency of _sysrepo-gnmi_ but it should be installed with sysrepo anyway. Though, make sure you have installed libyang with C++ library and header files.

Check [here](https://github.com/sysrepo/sysrepo/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for installation instructions of sysrepo.


# Install

You can run scripts/install.sh to install the required version of libyang or use an older version and apply commit bf1aa13ba2dfb7b5938ed2345a67de316fc34917 to it.

```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

# Generate PKI (Recommanded)

On CA machine:

```
#Generate a self-signed certificate for CA if you donâ€™t have one
openssl  req -x509 -days  365 -nodes  -newkey  rsa:2048 -keyout  ca.key -out ca.crt
```

On gNMI server:

```
#Generate a private key & certificate request for server
#CN (Common Name) or FQDN is mandatory and must be server domain name
openssl  req -new -days  365 -nodes  -newkey  rsa:2048 -keyout  server.key -out  server.certreq.csr
cat server.certreq.csr | grep "CERTIFICATE REQUEST" #check it is a cert request
```

On CA machine:

```
#CA sign server certificate request:
openssl  x509 -req -days  360 -in server.certreq.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -sha256
```

On client machine:

```
#Generate client key, certificate request, make CA sign it
#FQDN is optional because server can not initiate TLS connection for now (Dialout)
openssl  req -new -days  365 -nodes  -newkey  rsa:2048 -keyout  client.key -out  client.certreq.csr
```

On CA machine:

```
#CA sign client certificate request:
openssl x509 -req -days 360 -in client.certreq.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -sha256
```

# Get started

* Server/client in INSECURE mode (no username/password) and no TLS connection
```
gnmi_server -f
gnmi -addr localhost:50051 get /ietf-interfaces:interfaces-state
```

* Server/client with TLS connection for encryption and authentication:
```
gnmi_server -k server.key -c server.crt -l4
gnmi -addr localhost:50051 -certfile=client.crt -keyfile=client.key get /ietf-interfaces:interfaces-state
```

* Server/client with username/password + TLS connection for encryption only:
```
gnmi_server -k server.key -c server.crt --username cisco --password cisco -l4
gnmi -addr localhost:50051 -cafile ca.crt -username cisco -password cisco get /ietf-interfaces:interfaces-state
```

# Examples

## Capabilities RPC

```
gnmi -addr localhost:50051 capabilities
```

## Set RPC

Create a JSON file named tmp.json :

```
{
    "ietf-interfaces:interfaces": {
        "interface": [
            {
                "name": "GigabitEthernet0/8/0",
                "type": "iana-if-type:ethernetCsmacd",
                "enabled": false
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

```
gnmi -addr localhost:50051 update / tmp.json
```

## Get RPC:

```
gnmi -addr localhost:50051 get /ietf-interfaces:interfaces/ 
gnmi -addr localhost:50051 get /ietf-interfaces:interfaces/ /openconfig-interfaces:interfaces
```

## Subscribe RPC:

Install and run `influxdb` & `chronograf`. Then open your browser to have `chronograf` web page.

Create your telegraf configuration:

```
[[inputs.cisco_telemetry_gnmi]]
  ## List of device addresses to collect telemetry from
  service_address = "localhost:50051"

  ## Authentication details. Username and password are must if device expects
  ## authentication. Client ID must be unique when connecting from multiple instances
  ## of telegraf to the same device
  username = "cisco"
  password = "cisco"

  ## x509 Certificate to use with TLS connection. If it is not provided, an insecure
  ## channel will be opened with server
  # tls = true
  # tls_ca = "/cert.pem"

  ## Encoding json, json_ietf, proto
  # encoding = "json_ietf"
  # encoding = "json"
  encoding = "json_ietf"

  [[inputs.cisco_telemetry_gnmi.subscription]]
    path = "/ietf-interfaces:interfaces-state"

    # Subscription mode (one of: "target_defined", "sample", "on_change") and interval
    subscription_mode = "sample"
    sample_interval = "4s"

    ## Suppress redundant transmissions when measured values are unchanged
    # suppress_redundant = false

    ## If suppression is enabled, send updates at least every X seconds anyway
    # heartbeat_interval = "60s"

[[outputs.file]]
  files = ["stdout"]

[[outputs.influxdb]]
  url = "http://localhost:8086"
  database = "telemetry"
  precision = "s"
```

Run telegraf

```
telegraf --config telegraf.conf
```

# FAQ

Why does it use libyang rather than a JSON library?
===================================================

A JSON library would not be enough because JSON is not detailed enough and miss information required to build an XPATH (key of sysrepo datastore).

Typically, in a JSON encoded format containing a list, you don't know which field would be the YANG key of the list element.

Ex: /ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface contains multiple leaves. "name" is the key but JSON does not give this information.

What is the problem with JSON and JSON_IETF encodings?
======================================================

Your gnmi client for a `get` or `subscribe` rpc must have yang models downloaded if it wants to recognize which is the key from a JSON list.

Ex: Which field is the key for interface list ?

```
{
   "interface" : [
      {
         "admin-status" : "down",
         "name" : "GigabitEthernet0/8/0",
         "oper-status" : "down",
         "phys-address" : "08:00:27:60:b7:12",
         "speed" : "1000000",
         "type" : "iana-if-type:ethernetCsmacd"
      },
      {
         "admin-status" : "down",
         "name" : "local0",
         "oper-status" : "down",
         "phys-address" : "00:00:00:00:00:00",
         "speed" : "0",
         "type" : "iana-if-type:ethernetCsmacd"
      }
   ]
}
```


What is the problem using different encoding to store xpath in a database?
==========================================================================

The problem is that all encodings do not agree on the type which must be used to store a value.
For example:
`/ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface[name="eth0"]/statistics/octets` can be stored as a `uint64_t` with no encoding or as a `string` with JSON IETF encoding.

Why Protobuf/Binary/ASCII encoding are not supported?
=====================================================

Protobuf, binary and ASCII encodings requires gNMI client and server to have a convention regarding the data exchanged.
On the contrary, JSON IETF [RFC7951] and JSON are self describing, so both clients and server nows how data is encoded (Key:Value).

What is no encoding? When should I use it?
==========================================

No encoding means your value can be encoded in one of the following type i.e. string, int64, uint64, bool, bytes, float, Decimal64.
This types are all supported types for a YANG leaf node.

If you are using "No Encoding", or "Native Encoding", you must know that it is not part of gNMI specification.
I took some liberty and if you use `PROTO` field of gnmi encoding enumeration.
Because it encode yang leaves, the xpath, you will receive are all xpath for YANG leaves.

It should be used if:

* Your gNMI client support raw types;
* You are making a Get or Subscribe Request;
* You are making a Set request with a XPATH qualifying a YANG leaf;
* You want to exchange lighter messages (typically for telemetry).
